# Seasons

## Important todos
- make sure each exit value is correct
- check mt cucco cave going up - can you jump down snow block?
- tarm entrances either shouldn't lead to dungeons, or should require gale seeds to be in logic
- soft lock warnings

## Smoother experience 
- currently Moblin keep outer entrances are just not considered in logic, which is a nice fix for making sure you can still blow it up. I could probably do something better for it. Need to consider more options
- fix sprites in some subrosia houses, notably smithy and minigame  
- (if adding minigame into rando, need to fix exit warping to vanilla location)
- correct rupee/ore chunk display
- ore chunk farming logic

## Future ideas
- hard logic idea - 2d spring tower section with bombs/seeds
- hide and seek without feather
- check d2 deku scrub - for logical bombs

# Common
- tree warp in logic
- soft reset in logic (for one-ways, eg bomb caves, ember bushes and keys)
- Press up in doors specifically to go back through them?
- put gale seeds into logic in more places so that you can jump down usual soft lock cliffs 
- test state-related rooms, eg Seasons moblin rest house before and after defeating them
