# Out of logic

The following ways of navigating inner caves, etc are potential softlocks, if you have no way to get there naturally, or have gales seeds, or tree warp:

- jumping down the chimney of Holly's house

# Tricks/tips

- d2 & especially d6 rupee rooms may now hold more value in entrance rando
- the shield in the subrosia shop may be required more often in entrance rando, despite not being in the tracker/spoiler log. Mostly for d3 or d6 spiky beetles
- only shovel or dancing minigame is considered in logic for ore chunk farming

# Entrances not randomized

Some of these could just break the game, possibly in fun ways, but the idea is that this rando could potentially be much more configurable, eg outer entrances can also lead to outer entrances, entrances locked to their world, etc

Some could be added in the near future

## Holodrum
- Onox - could be an option - would make for some quick seeds, and a fun rare case where onox is locked behind an item in vanilla onox location (eg shovel is there, and onox in stairs behind clock shop)
- Twinrova/Ganon dungeon
- Maku tree-related entrances - could be a fun addition, so keeping track of dungeons beaten is important
- The 2 quicksands in samasa desert, Holly's roof
- Dimitri caves - same reason as above, but also gotta make sure dimitri is handled well when both entering and exiting
- Cave leading up to western coast graveyard - currently due to not being able to go down the same cave once in the graveyard
- D2 stairs - usual soft lock scenarios in regular rando
- Natzu dimitri waterfall

## Subrosia
- Pirate boat stairs - mostly because the 2 in the 2 deserts disappear when the pirate captain gets his bell. Could possibly make it so that the 1 in subrosia desert, and the 1 in western coast lead to the same place, and where it leads to can be considered in logic (assuming you can reach the subrosia desert entrance)
- Thieves house entrances - could soft lock you
- The Key cave connecting subrosia beach to subrosia temple - you need Rosa to unlock these. A possible future change could include these by removing the inner locked doors, and then the outer ones can logically require Rosa
- Subrosia dancing minigame - need to sort out the warp that takes you to the vanilla entrance once the game finishes
