# Out of logic

TODO. Basically jumping off any cliff where you can't access the bottom otherwise

# Tricks/tips

- Find opportunities to use Tune of Ages more. Currents can also be useful, eg accessing the secluded regions in Rolling Ridge
- Maku tree roof essence requirements (left to right): 6, 1, 3, 4

# Entrances not randomized
- Possibly missing some other than the below

## Past
- Waterfall to d6 past
- GBA shop
- Past black tower - just need to check what happens when flag is set that turns it into last dungeon. Aim is to make its outer entrance lead to the same place if flag is set or not, and its inner entrances (flag set or not) reachable by the same outer entrance

## Present
- Maku tree path, both entrances. Used to access portal, can be added if I move/add portal outside the cave
- Entrance into Maku tree
- Entrance from Maku tree to her roof entrances
- Moblin keep-related entrances
