# Out of logic

- Switch hooking to Octor fairy cave without mermaid suit to go back

# Tricks/tips

- Find opportunities to use Tune of Ages more. Currents can also be useful, eg accessing the secluded regions in Rolling Ridge
- Clean seas can open up more than you know. And also, with late mermaid suit, dimitri becomes more useful
- Maku tree roof essence requirements (left to right): 6, 1, 3, 4

# Entrances not randomized
- Possibly missing some other than the below
- Linked-related entrances

## Past
- Waterfall to d6 past
- Past black tower - just need to check what happens when flag is set that turns it into last dungeon. Aim is to make its outer entrance lead to the same place if flag is set or not, and its inner entrances (flag set or not) reachable by the same outer entrance
- Dive spot N Talus Peaks
- D2 (just need to test past and present, entering and exiting works)

## Present
- Maku tree path, both entrances. Used to access portal, can be added if I move/add portal outside the cave
- Entrance into Maku tree
- Entrance from Maku tree to her roof entrances
- Moblin keep-related entrances
- Nuun dimitri waterfall
